# MULTITHREADED-SOCKET-SERVER
A multithreaded server socket in C++ is a powerful tool for building network applications that require high performance and scalability. It allows multiple threads to handle client connections simultaneously, improving overall performance and providing flexibility for a wide range of applications.

## Overview
An implementation of a multithreaded server socket in C++ involves creating a server that listens for incoming connections from clients. Each client connection is accepted by the server, and a new thread is spawned to handle the communication with that client.

The server maintains a pool of worker threads that handle the actual data transfer with the clients. When a new client connection is accepted, a worker thread is assigned to that connection. The worker thread communicates with the client by reading from and writing to the socket associated with the connection.

## Features
* Direct POSIX socket use.
* Native Linux Threads support
* Modern c++ techniques
* Http remaker (personized HTTP response
